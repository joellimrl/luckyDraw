# Lucky draw static web page

# How to

Update the following with the relevant information:

- background.jpg (Background image of web page)
- allImages and allPrizeText in common.js (Length should match)
- image folder (will all necessary images)

Upload a CSV file containing all the names and start drawing

## Todos

- Extract JSON file of names/winners, can be accepted as input also?
- display button to extract winners, only after extracted then the file input will reappear

Remove background, items in common.js to be moved to external file

Then maybe look at state?
